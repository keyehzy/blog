	<h2>Finishing my PhD</h2>

	<p> I just finished the doctorate program at PUC-Rio and now
	  am Ph.D in Physics. It was a long way to get here: moving out,
	  COVID, five papers. Looking back and thinking about it and how
	  I got through that, but somehow we all did.

	<p> The last few years were very tough, very challenging and
	  (believe me) very rewarding. There is no better feeling than
	  getting all the weight out of your shoulders, get your all
	  the hard work you put in it validated by people that you
	  respect a lot.

	<p> Somehow how it all worked out, the presentation went way
	  better than expected (and my advisor agree with me), and I
	  could convince the committee that I am worth the diploma.

	<p> It doesn't get necessarily easier from now on. I will soon
	  go to Shanghai for a postdoc, a completely new adventure
	  waits for me. As a postdoc, I will be able to work on very
	  interesting physics and I look forward to that. I also want
	  to mentor young students and I hope I have the opportunity
	  to do it.

	<p> If you are interested in my presentation and my
	  presentation you can get the
	  slides <a href="../media/phd_thesis_slides.pdf">here</a>. Unfortunately
	  the presentation was not recorded, but you can get an idea of
	  the content of my research.
